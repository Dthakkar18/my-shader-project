Paragraph:
I have a sphere that has an initail animated wave pattern depicted over it in the vertex shader.
Then I pulled a noise function to give the wave pattern more flare and not as symetric, which was also added in the vertex shader.
After that I altered the ditances of the vertices of the object based on the pattern created after the noise was applied.
Then I passed the pattern from the vertex shader to the fragment shader to have approiate colors for the object.
Then I created uniforms for "object color", "glow", "distortion" and "noise" which helped enable the user to edit the object in real time.


[X] create an initial basic wave pattern
[X] incorperate different noise functions to the wave pattern 
[X] have vertex distances follow with pattern
[X] add glow effect to the object
[X] add distortion effect
[X] user can manipulate x, y and z of camera
[X] user can manipulate the color (rgb) of the object
[X] user can manipulate the glow effect  
[X] user can manipulate the amount of wave effect
[X] user can toggle the presence of the noises
[X] user can toggle the presence of vertex distance manipulation
